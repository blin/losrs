### base_font_size

"base" font size in points.

[ENV: LOSRS__OUTPUT__BASE_FONT_SIZE]

### line_height_scaling

Some terminals allow scaling line height (and some scale by default),
this value needs to be known to calculate the right image size.

as your terminal line height scaling.

Used with image based formats.

[default: 1.2]
